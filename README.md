# 📚 Book Lending Tracker

A simple and intuitive **book lending tracker** built with **React + Redux Toolkit**.  
Keep track of books you lend to friends — who borrowed them, and when they should return them.  
You can add new books, edit existing ones, and mark books as returned.  
Also, the app supports **light and dark themes**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📖 **Add new books** with title, author, friend name, and return date  
- ✏️ **Edit existing books** if plans change  
- ✅ **Mark a book as returned** — once saved as returned, it is automatically removed from the list  
- 🎨 **Light / Dark theme toggle** with persistence (saved in localStorage)  
- 💾 **Data persistence** — your books are saved in localStorage, so they stay even after page reload
